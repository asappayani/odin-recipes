# Odin Recipes

A simple recipe website built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## What This Is

This is a basic multi-page site that displays a few recipes using only HTML and CSS. Itâ€™s meant to reinforce the fundamentals of building and styling static web pages.

## Why Iâ€™m Building This

Iâ€™m following The Odin Project to learn full-stack web development from the ground up. This project was my first chance to:
- Practice writing semantic HTML
- Structure a basic website with internal page navigation
- Apply foundational CSS for layout and visual styling

## What I Added

After getting the HTML structure down, I went back and added some simple CSS to:
- Style text and layout
- Add basic colors and spacing
- Improve readability and visual flow

Nothing fancy â€” just enough to get comfortable with selectors, properties, and how CSS interacts with HTML.

## Goals

- Practice clean, semantic HTML
- Understand how CSS targets and styles elements
- Build the habit of committing work to Git/GitHub as I go

## Tech Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Git & GitHub

## Status

âœ… Basic structure and styling complete  
ðŸš§ Will continue refining as I learn more
