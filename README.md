# odin recipes

A basic recipe website built with HTML as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## What This Is

This is a simple static website that displays a few recipes. Itâ€™s made using just HTML to practice core web development skills like:
- Structuring a webpage with semantic HTML
- Using tags like `<a>`, `<img>`, `<ul>`, `<h1>`â€“`<h6>`, etc.
- Creating internal links between pages
- Organizing content cleanly and logically

## Why Iâ€™m Building This

This project is my first hands-on exercise in HTML. Itâ€™s not meant to be fancy â€” itâ€™s meant to reinforce the basics. Iâ€™m following The Odin Project to build a solid foundation in full-stack web development, and this is step one: mastering HTML structure and page linking.

## Goals

- Practice writing clean, semantic HTML
- Understand how multi-page websites are organized
- Get used to the habit of committing progress to Git/GitHub

## Tech Used

- HTML5
- Git & GitHub (for version control)

## Status

ðŸš§ In progress â€“ building and refining as I go through the curriculum.
