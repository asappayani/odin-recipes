            <div class="recipe-directions">
                <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to
                        375
                        degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Whisk egg in large mixing bowl. Add chicken, salt,
                        sugar,
                        and
                        pepper; mix well. Mix in cornstarch, a little bit at a
                        time,
                        until chicken is well coated.</li>
                    <li>Working in batches, carefully drop one piece of chicken
                        at a
                        time into the hot oil. Fry until chicken turns golden
                        brown
                        and
                        begins to float, about 3 minutes. Remove chicken to a
                        plate
                        and
                        allow to cool as you fry the next batch.</li>
                    <li>Once all of the chicken has been fried, refry the
                        chicken,
                        starting with the batch that was cooked first. Fry each
                        batch
                        until chicken turns deep golden brown, about 2 minutes
                        more.
                        Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
                    <li>To make the sauce: Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large
                        skillet
                        over high heat. Stir in green onion, garlic, whole
                        chiles,
                        and
                        orange zest. Cook and stir until garlic turns golden and
                        chiles
                        brighten, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add sugar, soy sauce, chicken broth, peanut oil, rice
                        vinegar,
                        sesame oil, and ginger; bring to a boil and cook for 3
                        minutes.
                        Whisk 2 teaspoons of cornstarch in water until
                        dissolved.
                        Stir
                        into the boiling sauce. Return to a boil and cook until
                        the
                        sauce thickens and is no longer cloudy from the
                        cornstarch,
                        about 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Stir chicken into the boiling sauce. Reduce heat to low
                        and
                        cook
                        until chicken is heated through and has absorbed some of
                        the
                        sauce, about 3 minutes.</li>
